Drug- Capomulin has been used for highest number of mice which is 230.
With help of piechart, it shows that male mice is higher in number (958) which is about 51% whereas female mice number is 922 which acounts for around 49%.
Around timepoint (days) of 20, there is maximum increase in tumor volume.
With scatter plot, after timepoint of 20 there is more increase in tumor volume.
The correlation between Weight and Average Tumor Volume is 0.84 which is a strongly correlated (positive) and tumor volume increases with weight.
Regression tells how much Tumor volume changes with the weight change of mice. The r-squared value is 0.7088568047708723 which is around 70% which shows it     is a good model fit for the data and variance is around the mean value.
